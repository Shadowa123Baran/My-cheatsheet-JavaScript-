## My-cheatsheet
### Day 45. I am learning Webpack, in this repository there are many different and interesting works collected by me during my learning.

### To make everything work, you need to enter the following commands into the terminal:
#### npm init -y
#### npm install -D @babel/core @babel-preset-env
### Before that, you need to download node.js

#### Last update: 10.02.23

#### At the moment I am learning presets.
